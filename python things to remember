Python functions and codes 


if(end with : for continuation)
Else continue with :
Sep’’ used for deleting spaces
End’’ used to print result in one line
from __future__ import division (used for “for i in”codes)
.strip is used to remove special characters or spaces and a the like
.split is used to make it a list 
(*) is used to extract contents of a variable etc
If else can be used in multiples based on the block coordination
Return needs:(returns to the start of the code unless other coordinates are mentioned)
% can be used in coordination with ==(for equals to)or != for not equals to 
Sort makes the list in ascending order(there is a way to make in descending order s well look it up when the time comes)
Set makes the list into one object the order is random unless there is some other command influence
You can use [=/-n] in sorted lists to select the number you want 
Map can be used to change the quality of a variable
Unless mentioned it is considered a float value in python 3 int command can be used to make sure it is an int value/command
For(int),and(int),is in(int),range command(can be used identify range of numbers)(maybe you can look up how to manipulate range function for negative numbers and for other ways of using it,
